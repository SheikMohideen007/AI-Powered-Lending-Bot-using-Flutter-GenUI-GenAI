AI-Powered Lending Bot using Flutter, GenUI, and Gemini 2.5 Pro

This project is an AI-powered Lending Chatbot built entirely using:

Flutter (UI Framework)

GenUI (Generative UI for Flutter)

Google Gemini 2.5 Pro via Firebase AI

Custom UI Catalog Widgets (bureau card, customer card, loan details etc.)

The bot interacts with users and dynamically renders UI components based on AI instructions using A2UI tool calls.

This is a real-world demo of building a smart lending assistant using Generative UI + LLMs for:

✅ CIF ID Verification
✅ Customer KYC Details
✅ Loan Product Selection
✅ Bureau Score Simulation
✅ Loan Slider with Local EMI Calculation
✅ Loan Application Submission
